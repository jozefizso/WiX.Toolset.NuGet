## Release 3.10.2-ext2

Package **3.10.2-ext2** contains the WiX v3.10.2 binaries with custom build of `burn.exe`.

There are two changes in the `burn.exe` application:
* New `WixBundleUILevel` property. Burn engine will set it to the value of the UI display level of the bootstrapper.
* Language used to localize the bootstrapper interface is determined by the `GetUserDefaultUILanguage()` function. There is a new corresponding `UserUILanguageID` property available.
